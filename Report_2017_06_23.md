##Classes
###Define
ClassName begins with an Uppercase. 
```
class ClassName 
	...
end
```
###Initialize Method
When we create the Class, and create an Object of the Class, it will call the Initialize method. If we create more than one Initialize method, it will use the last Initialize method. And we have to give enough parameter.
```
class Dog
	def initialize(namee, color, gender)
		@name	=	namee
		@color	=	color
		@gender = gender
	end
	def	initialize(namee, color)
		@name	=	namee
		@color	=	color
	end
end
myDog	=	Dog.new('Lucky', 'White')
puts myDog
```
###Instance of class
If we want to create Instant of a class, we use "new" and we give it the argument.
```
myDog	=	Dog.new('Lucky', 'White')
```
###Getter and setter
We want to set and get value of the variables when we add, we create Setter and Getter method same another language.
```
class Dog
	def	name
		@name
	end
	def	name=(str)
		@name	=	str
 	end
 end
 dog 	=	Dog.new
dog.name	=	'Lucky'
dog.name	#	=>	"Lucky"
```
In ruby, we can create Setter and Getter shoter than another language
```
class Dog
	attr_reader :name
	attr_writer :name
end
```
If we want to write Getter and Setter in a line
```
class Dog
 	attr_accessor :name 
 end
```
###Class Method
Class method is a method of class. Class can call the Class method, but Object cannot call the Class method.
We can define 
```
class Dog
	def Dog.dog_act
		puts "GauGau"
	end
end
Dog.dog_act
#Output:GauGau 
```
###Inheritance
When class B inheritance class A, we can use "super" to inheritance attribute and method in class A
```
class A
	private
	def sum
		1+1
	end
	public
	def get_sum
		sum
	end
end

class B<A
	private 
	def sum
		super
	end
	public
 	def get_sum
 		sum
 	end
 end
 b = B.new
 p b.get_sum()
 #Output: 2
```

##Modules
###Define
Module is a set of method and constants. Module is like class.
```
module	Act
	def	bark
		puts "GauGau"
	end
end
class	Dog
	include	Act	
end
dog = Dog.new
dog.bark
#Output: GauGau
```
###Include & Extend
- When we use Include, the object of class can call the method of module
- When we use Extend, the class can call the method of module
```
module	Act
	def	bark
		puts "GauGau"
	end
end
class	Dog
	include	Act	
end
class Cat
	extend Act
end
Dog.new.bark
Cat.bark
#Output: GauGau GauGau
```
