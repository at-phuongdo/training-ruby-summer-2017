##Arrays
###Define
Array is a collection of any objects. Each element is reference by an index from 0.
	
###Creating arrays
There are many way to create an array, such as:
```
arr = Array.new
```
Or if you want to create an array with size
```
arr = Array.new(5)
``` 
You can create an array has many element same as.
```
arr = Array.new(5,"a") 
#result is an array: arr =[a,a,a,a,a]
```
Create an array has many element consecutive from i to j
```
arr = Array.new(1..5)
#result is an array: arr =[1,2,3,4,5]
```
Create an array has step  
```
arr = Array.new(5){|i| i*2}
#result is an array: arr =[0,2,4,6,8]
```
Another way,  we can set value to the element
```
arr =["a",1,"b"]
#result is an array: arr =[a,1,b]
```
###Access Item in array
To access the Item in array, we can use many ways
```
array[2]
array.at(2)
```
If we want to get the value of the first element
```
arr=[1,2,3,4,5]
arr.first
arr[0]
```
If we want to get the value of the last elemment
```
arr=[1,2,3,4,5]
arr.last
arr[arr.length-1]
arr[-1]
```
###Return the size of array
```
array.size
array.length
array.count

```
###Add Items to Arrays
We can add the item to the end of array
```
arr=[1,2,3,4,5]
arr.push(10)
#result: [1,2,3,4,5,10]
arr<<"Hello"
#result: [1,2,3,4,5,"Hello"]
```
If we want to add an element to a position
```
arr=[1,2,3,4,5]
arr.insert(2,"Hello")
#result: [1,2,"Hello",3,4,5]
```
###Collect
To create an new array, contain the value return form block code
```
arr = [1,2,3,4,5]
arr1= arr.collect{|i|i*2}
#result: [2,4,6,8,10]
```
